    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A famous chinese street snack of candied fruit</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 assorted small fresh fruit (e.g. hawthorn, strawberries, grapes, tangerine pieces)</li>
        <li>3 quarters cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 third cup of water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare fruit into bite-sized pieces and pat them dry with paper towels</li>
        <li>Slide 3 pieces of fruit each onto 5 bamboo skewers. Place skewers onto baking sheet lined with paper towels</li>
        <li>Put granulated sugar, water and light corn syrup in a shallow pan. Cook over over medium heat (do not stir) until sugar dissolves and mixture boils.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and cook (without stirring) until syrup reaches 310 degree F and looks a faint golden hue</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let syrup stand until bubble subside</li>
        <li>While syrup is hot, tilt the pan so that the syrup pools to one side. Lightly touch the side of each fruit skewer onto the surface of the syrup and quickly rotate the skewer in one direction to evenly coat the surface</li>
        <li>Place skewer, fruit side up into a heavy cup/container. Let it naturally cool and harden</li>
    </ol>
